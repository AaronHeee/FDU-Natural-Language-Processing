# FDU-NLP-Word2Vec-And-Sentiment-Analysis
This is my fourth project of NLP class.

## Assignment04

- this is the given assignment pdf file, we just follow the guide to implement our project.

##Assignment04 Solution

- this is my solution to *Assignment04*, which contains my derived cost function and gradient.

## data_utils.py

- This file is used to read data from our dataset. 

## datasets

- Stanford Sentiment Treebank(SST) dataset 

## gradcheck.py

- This file is used to check whether your grad is right or not 

## plot.py

- my own function to plot experiment results for writing project report

## results

- contains saved different parameters and  their corresponding testing results, word_vector plot, reg_acc plot
- run_time_record is a file helps me keep track of training time, for achieve higher efficiency 

## run.py

- Train your own word vectors and visualize it. 
- This file can be edited if you want to change the hyperparameter for better performance

## sentiment.py

- This file is used to complete the sentiment analysis mission. Your work is to find the best hyper parameter and regularization parameter.

## sgd.py

- This file is used to run stochastic gradient descent. 

## softmaxreg.py

- This file is used to train a softmax regression model, and the softmax regression part is given. Your work is to implement the feature extraction part. 

## word2vec.py

- This file is used to build your word2vec model , including 

  calculation of your cost and gradient.
